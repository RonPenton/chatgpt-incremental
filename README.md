`chatgpt-incremental`

This is an incremental game that was conjured up by ChatGPT with the seed phrase "write a very simple incremental game in react".

Followup commands:

* show me the package.json file for this project
* show me an html page that renders the react component
* write me a webpack config 
* write a script for package.json that builds the webpack
* I think you need to use react-dom

All I did was copy the code and assemble it into a file structure.
